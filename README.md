## Introduction to OOP

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, each of which represents a real-world entity or concept. Java is an object-oriented programming language that provides a robust framework for developing software using OOP principles.

## Key Concepts

### Classes and Objects

Classes are blueprints for creating objects. They define the attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods) that objects of that class will have. Objects are instances of classes and can interact with each other by invoking methods and accessing attributes.

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and allows creating specialized classes based on more general ones.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables methods to be invoked on objects without knowing their exact types. This is achieved through method overriding and interfaces.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Access to the internal details of a class is controlled, promoting data security and preventing unintended modifications.

### Abstraction

Abstraction involves representing complex real-world entities with simplified models in code. It hides unnecessary implementation details and focuses on essential features, making code more manageable and maintainable.

## Getting Started

To explore the examples and concepts in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the specific concept's folder you're interested in.
3. Read the documentation and study the code examples provided.

## Examples

This repository provides practical examples for each key OOP concept discussed above. The examples are organized into folders corresponding to each concept. Each example includes a README file explaining the concept and how it's implemented in the code.
